# Vaults Protocol

## Launch a vault. Earn yield. Manage your positions with NFTs.

**Vaults** is a DeFi/NFT-based smart contract protocol for launching **customizable, yield-bearing token vaults**. Once a vault’s rules and yield strategy are configured and deployed to the EVM blockchain of your choice, anyone can contribute ERC-20 tokens to mint an ERC-721 NFT representing their yield-bearing position. Use these NFTs to raise funds for charity, govern a vault’s funds as a DAO or multisig, gamble in the ultimate FOMO-inducing ponzi game, and much more!
